<p><strong>Due:</strong> 04/01/2020</p>
<p><strong>Chapter:</strong> 6</p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Create an application that will "parse" an HTML document.  This assignment is just about parsing.. and not the actual processing of the HTML "tags"</p>
<p><strong>Purpose: </strong> To demonstrate your understanding of natural language processing and reading from files</p>
<p><strong>Requirements: </strong>Copy and paste the relevant portions of your source code into a Word document (Do not submit an application).  Also include a "screen shot" of the output (I realize that some of the text will have scrolled away)</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the following file as the "raw" (unformatted) input</li>
<li>I'd recommend that you read the file one line at at time... and process the lines into "words"</li>
<li>Output the parsed data onto the screen</li>
<li>Put each HTML "tag" (a tag starts with "<" and ends with ">" on a separate line</li>
<li>Put all text that appears between the starting tag (tag with a slash) and ending tag (tag has a slash) on a separate line</li>
<li>Include a screen shot of at least some of the output</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Take a look at this screen shot as an example of how it should appear</em></p>
<p><strong>Expectations: </strong>A single Microsoft Word document</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Submit your file using the naming convention in the syllabus, for example: "CIS4340 Assignment5 Doe.John.docx"</p>
